PromiseJS
=========

This is a promise implementation, to use as a fallback, for when there is no default implementation.

It is compatible with AMD, and passes JSlint validation, with the present configuration.

The API mirrors the current implementation of the Promise in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

See the [Promise on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for
documentation.
